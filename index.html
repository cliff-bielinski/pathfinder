                <p>A* Search Algorithm - a modifiction of Dijkstra's Algorithm which aims to find the shortest path
                    between two distances. It maintains a tree of paths extending out from the starting node and extends
                    the paths until the end node is reached. Unlike Dijkstra's Algorithm, which solely chooses nodes to explore
                    based on the next shortest distance from the beginning, A* adds an additional heuristic function which 
                    estimates the remaining cost to reach the end in addition to the distance from the beginning 
                    to choose its next node.
